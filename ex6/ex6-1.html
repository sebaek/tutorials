        [Jaguar hisses] and meek prey. [Judy gives an innocent look. Boxes, labeled "Viscious Predator" and "Meek Prey" lower
        down and cover them. Bobby plays the hammered dulcimer, then the harp, when Sharla the sheep in white robe-like clothing
        tosses confetti from a basket over the bags and prances around.] But over time, we evolved and looked beyond our
        primitive savage ways. [The boxes pull up and Judy and Jaguar are in white robes as well. Sharla pops a noisemaker
        and Judy and Jaguar hold paws] Now, predator and prey live in harmony and every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.
        Sharla: Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore. [takes off white clothing, revealing an astronaut outfit and
        puts on a helmet] Instead, I can be an astronaut! [The crowd applauds as Bobby plays a slide whistle indicating alien
        music.] Jaguar: [slightly monotone from nervousness] I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore. [takes off robe-clothing,
        revealing a nice suit and tie, and takes out a pen, his voice becomes more confident.] Today I can hunt for tax exemptions;
        I'm gonna be an actuary! [The crowd applauds again as Bobby plays the piano.] Young Judy Hopps: And I can make the
        world a better place, I am going to be... [Bobby turns on a radio and moves his head side to side with the beat of
        the police music that is heard, and Judy tears off the clothing revealing a police officer's uniform] ...a police
        officer! [Bonnie and Stu look shocked and glance at each other in worry.] Young Gideon Grey: [laughs, nudging Travis]
        Bunny cop! That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard. Young Judy Hopps: [puts on a police officer's hat] It may
        seem impossible to small minds - I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey - [Gideon glares at her; the jungle backdrop curtain
        on the stage rises, revealing a colorful painted mural of Zootopia behind it. Sharla and Jaguar hold up a banner
        reading "where anyone can be anything"; Bobby plays the piano in the background.] but, just two-hundred and eleven

        on the stage rises, revealing a colorful painted mural of Zootopia behind it. Sharla and Jaguar hold up a banner
        reading "where anyone can be anything"; Bobby plays the piano in the background.] but, just two-hundred and eleven
        miles aw[Jaguar hisses] and meek prey. [Judy gives an innocent look. Boxes, labeled "Viscious Predator" and "Meek Prey" lower
        down and cover them. Bobby plays the hammered dulcimer, then the harp, when Sharla the sheep in white robe-like clothing
        tosses confetti from a basket over the bags and prances around.] But over time, we evolved and looked beyond our
        primitive savage ways. [The boxes pull up and Judy and Jaguar are in white robes as well. Sharla pops a noisemaker
        and Judy and Jaguar hold paws] Now, predator and prey live in harmony and every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.
        Sharla: Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore. [takes off white clothing, revealing an astronaut outfit and
        puts on a helmet] Instead, I can be an astronaut! [The crowd applauds as Bobby plays a slide whistle indicating alien
        music.] Jaguar: [slightly monotone from nervousness] I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore. [takes off robe-clothing,
        revealing a nice suit and tie, and takes out a pen, his voice becomes more confident.] Today I can hunt for tax exemptions;
        I'm gonna be an actuary! [The crowd applauds again as Bobby plays the piano.] Young Judy Hopps: And I can make the
        world a better place, I am going to be... [Bobby turns on a radio and moves his head side to side with the beat of
        the police music that is heard, and Judy tears off the clothing revealing a police officer's uniform] ...a police
        officer! [Bonnie and Stu look shocked and glance at each other in worry.] Young Gideon Grey: [laughs, nudging Travis]
        Bunny cop! That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard. Young Judy Hopps: [puts on a police officer's hat] It may

        miles away stands the great city of Zootopia, where our ancestors first joined together in peace and declared that

        the camcorder and he and Bonnie look at each other in worry] Thank you and good night!
